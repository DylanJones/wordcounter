# WordCounter

This is an old project that is pretty much just a Markov chain generator.  I spent a while on it before I knew anything about Big O, then came back to it and made it a few orders of magnitude faster once I understood efficiency.

### Usage
Put your source text in a file in this directory, then run `python WordCounter2.py` to generate the model.  To generate some random text, run `python SentanceGenerator.py <model name>`.
